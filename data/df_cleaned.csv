GoodParty.org is looking for a Data Analytics Manager (title commensurate with experience) with 3+ years' work experience who’s got top notch skills in building data stacks, modeling, and data-driven problem solving. You’ll be the analytical backbone for our remote startup as we scale our impact.

GoodParty.org is a tech platform and movement powering the mission to make people matter more than money in our democracy.

GoodParty.org is founded and fully funded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.

Why?

Americans – especially young people – are losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether.

A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans, nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about the environment, healthcare costs, wars, inequality, or our individual freedoms, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom-loop of dysfunctional partisan politics.

While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (e.g. Congress and President), GoodParty.org is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States, 70% of which are uncontested, we are powering a grassroots revolution to take back our communities from career politicians by helping real people run and win local and state level campaigns all across the country.

How?

GoodParty.org’s solution is to make it simple to run, win and serve. We offer free AI powered tools to help real people run and win elections, independent of partisan support or big money. We train people to run for office and support candidates who take our pledge so they don’t have to sell out to the Democrats or Republicans, raise big money, or cow-tow to special interests. Our free AI Campaign Manager and team with 50+ years of campaign experience make running, winning and serving as an independent, people-powered anti-corruption candidate possible.

We’re also building a movement of bright, caring Americans who are ready to end this country's two-party political dysfunction. Our community’s collective power is being harnessed to elect the most promising independents around the country. By leveraging social media and creators, we’re making our mission to make people matter more than money mainstream.

What you’ll do:
• Work with the Executive team to lead building our organizational learning machine and enable fast, data-driven iterations across every function and major project.
• Design GoodParty.org’s end-to-end data system in close partnership with our Engineering team.and own our data visualization and business intelligence suite.
• Ensure OKRs and KPIs are effective, trackable, visible, and leading to desired results for our mission.
• Investigate lower performing areas and make recommendations for improvements.
• Lead cross-functional analytical projects for finance, product, marketing and politics.
• Build strategic models and financial models to inform decisions, prepare reports, and give presentations.
• Work with Exec team in developing a proprietary Candidate Viability model by analyzing candidate, election, and product usage data.
• Report to Chief Operating Officer working on the Ops Team

Who you are:
• You’re up for the audacious challenge of transforming civic leadership and impacting our democracy for Good.
• You don’t think the two-party system is the answer.
• You have at least 3 years of work experience in a business analytics or data analytics role.
• You are quantitative by nature with an MBA or Master's with an Analytics or Mathematics focus.
• Your technical skills include SQL, Tableau, beginner Python proficiency, and leveraging AI tools to do it all more efficiently.
• You create complex strategic and financial models to inform decisions.
• You can confidently put together polished, persuasive presentations.
• You know how to effectively visualize data and analytic insights for cross-functional stakeholders.
• You’re an effective project manager and can catch the details that others miss and notice issues as they’re emerging. You can’t help but proactively jump in to help solve them.
• You enjoy no day being the same, being given new challenges, and figuring out the best possible approach to quickly get to the desired outcome.

Bonus if:
• You have worked at a data-driven startup
• You have worked with a leading management consulting firm
• You have experience studying, working, or volunteering in politics, political activism, or democracy reform
• You’re sick of sitting on the sidelines watching our democracy fail to meet its potential

Why you should work for GoodParty.org:
• Join us in solving the biggest problem of our time – fixing our democracy – so all other problems can be solved
• We’re a Public Benefit Corporation that prioritizes social impact over profit
• Innovative Bitcoin denominated deferred bonus plan, allowing you to have the amazing upside of being in a startup while working on a truly meaningful mission

• 100% coverage of health, dental, and vision benefits for you and your dependents
• We encourage you to take time off to recharge and have an unlimited PTO (sick and vacation) policy. This is a marathon, not a sprint. We believe a work-life balance is needed to get there.
• We’ll make sure you’ve got what you need to work remotely through our workspace setup stipend
• If you work from home, we give $50/month to help with your internet and other expenses. If you prefer co-working, that’s an option we can discuss too.

Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $200,000 to $250,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.
Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at One. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Recognized for state-of-the-art computational infrastructure, well-established analytical pipelines, and deep genomic analysis expertise, St. Jude offers a work environment where you will directly impact the care of pediatric cancer patients. As a Senior Computational Research Scientist, your responsibilities include analyzing data generated from a variety of second- and third-generation sequencing applications that interrogate a broad range of human gene regulatory biology.

The Abraham lab studies gene expression-regulation mechanisms in healthy and diseased mammalian cells. We are recruiting computational biologists to collaboratively develop tools and frameworks to analyze high-throughput sequencing (-omics) data. We build analytical software pipelines to find answers to biological questions about gene regulation in genome-wide datasets, usually from applied sequencing experiments like CUT&RUN-Seq, RNA-Seq, and Hi-ChIP, as well as some single-cell experiments. Our interests center on enhancers and super-enhancers. Specifically, we seek to understand how these regulatory elements establish gene expression programs in healthy cells, and how enhancers are altered by mutation, abused by mistargeting, and targetable with drugs in diseased cells. We characterize the specific core regulatory circuitries driving disease-relevant cells and seek to understand how mutations in the non-coding DNA of such cells can drive disease, including cancers, through gene misregulation.

The successful candidate will become a fundamental component of a multidisciplinary, inter-institutional team assembled to study how gene expression regulation meaningfully differs between normal and pediatric cancer cells. The successful candidate will operate as a superdoc-type contributor who leads research projects within the laboratory with increasing independence in daily operation.

Ideal candidates will have experience building, tailoring, and deploying analysis pipelines using widely available genomic analysis toolkits (e.g. bedtools, samtools, HiCPro), as well as experience managing large numbers of datasets. The successful candidate will be tasked with collaborative research within and beyond the lab, so strong communication and interpersonal skills are essential. Additional experience in the fundamental understanding of gene expression mechanisms (e.g. transcription factors, enhancers, genome structure, and transcriptional condensates), and experience building succinct, clear figures using R are preferred.

The Department of Computational Biology provides access to high-performance computing clusters, a cloud computing environment, innovative visualization tools, highly automated analytical pipelines, and mentorship from faculty scientists with experience in data analysis, data management, and delivery of high-quality results for competitive projects. We encourage first-author, high-profile publications to share this element of discovery. Take the first step to joining our team by applying now!

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits for Full-Time Employees*

Anthropic's compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - For eligible roles, equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits for Full-Time Employees - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:
• Optional equity donation matching.
• Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
• 401(k) plan with 4% matching.

How we're different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact - advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI - rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
